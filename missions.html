            <h2>Mars Pathfinder Mission</h2>
            <h3>- Studied rocks.</h3>
            <p>The Mars Pathfinder lander was designed primarily to demonstrate
               a low-cost way of delivering a set of science instruments and a
               free-ranging rover to the surface of the red planet. Assisted by
               an 11-meter-diameter (36-foot) parachute, the spacecraft descended
               to the surface of Mars on July 4, 1997 and landed, using airbags to
               cushion the impact.</p>

               <p><strong>Sojourners Discoveries :</strong></p>
               <p>Dust is confirmed as the dominant absorber of solar radiation
                  in Mars' atmosphere, which has important consequences for the
                  transport of energy in the atmosphere and its circulation.
                  Evidence of wind abrasion of rocks and dune-shaped deposits was
                  found, indicating the presence of sand. The possible identification
                  of rounded pebbles and cobbles on the ground, and sockets and
                  pebbles in some rocks, suggest conglomerates that formed in
                  running water, during a warmer past in which liquid water was
                  stable.</p>

               <p>The mission was planned for 7-days, but was extended in early
                  August. They communicated with Sojourner and the Pathfinder lander
                  for 83 days before they lost contact.</p>

               <p>The only remaining objective was to complete the high-resolution
                  360-degree image of the landing site called the "Super Pan."
                  83 percent had already been received and was being processed.</p>

               <p>The rover took 550 images, as well as more than 15 chemical
                  analyses of rocks and extensive data on winds and other weather
                  factors.</p>
            <aside>
               <p>This mission has advanced our knowledge of Mars tremendously
                  and will surely be a beacon of success for upcoming missions
                  to the red planet".</p>

                  Technology.</p>

            <h2>Mars Exploration Rovers Mission</h2>
            <h3>- Collected evidence of water.</h3>
            <p>The Mars Exploration Rovers Mission featured two identical,
               golf-cart-sized, solar-powered rovers: Spirit and Opportunity.
               Spirit launched june 10, 2003, and landed in Gusev Crater on
               January 4, 2004. Opportunity launched july 7, 2003, and landed
               on the opposite side of Mars at Meridiani Planum on January 25, 2004.
               Each rover bounced onto the surface inside a landing craft protected
               by airbags. When they stopped rolling, the airbags were deflated
               and the landing craft opened.</p>

            <p><strong>The Rovers Discoveries :</strong></p>
            <p>Opportunity discovered small spheres of hematite nicknamed "blueberries"
               that formed late from rising, acidic groundwater. Once Opportunity
               reached the rim of Endeavour Crater, the rover found white veins of
               the mineral gypsum- a telltale sign of water that traveled through
               underground fractures. Opportunity also found more compelling
               signs of Mars' watery past in the rocks of Endeavour Crater: clay
               minerals that formed in neutral-pH (not too acidic, not too basic)
               water. Of all the places studied by Opportunity, the environment
               at Endeavour had the friendliest conditions for ancient microbial
               life. The rover team chose Endeavour Crater as a long-term
               destination for Opportunity in mid-2008, after the rover had
               investigated the much-smaller Victoria Crater for two years.</p>

            <p>Spirit landed in a region called Gusev Crater. Scientists wanted
               to explore the crater because they thought it could have held water
               long ago. Spirit found severals signs of past water, and evidence
               of geothermal or volcanic activity. The rover took many photos of
               Mars with its camera and was the first rover on another planet that
               was able to send back color photos.</p>

            <p>Each rover far outlasted its design lifetime. Spirit´s final
               communication to Earth occurred on March 22, 2010, about six years
               into its mission. The rover lasted 20 times longer than its original
               design. Opportunity completed its three-month prime mission in
               April 2004 and has continued working in mission extensions since
               then. The last time the rover communicated with Earth was June 10, 2018.</p>

            <p>East Rim of Endeavour Crater: Opportunity used its panoramic camera
               to record this eastward horizon view on the 2,407th Martian day, or
               sol, of the rover´s work on Mars (Oct. 31, 2010).</p>

            <h2>Mars Science Laboratory Mission</h2>
            <h3>- Is Mars capable of supporting life?</h3>
            <p>August 2012 the rover Curiosity landed safely on Mars. Its mission
               was to explore a layered mountain inside Gale Crater to learn if
               ancient Mars was capable of supporting life.</p>

            <p><strong>Curiosity´s Discoveries:</strong></p>
            <p>Curiosity found rounded pebbles that hint of an ancient river, and
               a delta, where a river emptied into an ancient lake. Lakes spanned
               the crater floor, leaving mud that built the lower part of the
               mountain, inch by inch. The lakes came and went, and eventually
               dried up. But groundwater persisted, leaving minerals behind. Gale
               Crater was habitable for millions of years.</p>

            <p>Curiosity also has monitored radiation from the sun and space to
               help plan for the day when astronauts enjoy this same Martian view.</p>

            <p>The prime mission lasted one Mars year or about 23 Earth months,
               and Curiosity continues to operate on Mars today.</p>
          <aside>
            <p>Mount Sharp, also called Aeolis Mons, is a layered mound in the
              center of Mars'Gale Crater, rising more than 3 miles (5 kilometers)
              above the crater floor, where Curiosity has been working since
              the rover's landing in August 2012. Lower slopes of Mount Sharp are
              the major destination for the mission.</p>
