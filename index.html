           <p><strong>Landed on Mars:</strong> July 1997 at Ares Vallis.</p>
           <p>The first wheeled robot to rove the Red Planet.</p>
           <p>The rover explored an area of Mars near its landing site called
              Ares Vallis. Scientists were interested in this area because it
              looked like the site of an ancient flood. The rushing water of a
              flood would have pushed lots of rocks and dirt into one place.
              This means the rover could study lots of different types of rocks
              without traveling very far.</p>

           <p>Sojourner spent 83 days of a planned seven-day mission exploring the
              Martian terrain, acquiring images, and taking chemical, atmospheric
              and other measurements. The final data transmission received from the
              lander Pathfinder was at 10:23 UTC on September 27, 1997. Although
              mission managers tried to restore full communications during
              the following five months, the successful mission was terminated
              on March 10, 1998.</p>

           <p>Sojourner drove short distances and used its camera to take more
               than 550 pictures of the Red Planet.</p>

           <p><strong>Landed on Mars:</strong> January 2004 at Meridiani Planum
             (Opportunity) and Gusev Crater (Spirit).</p>

           <p>Twin rovers and the second and third wheeled robot to rove the Red
              Planet.</p>

           <p>Opportunity and Spirit were sent to Mars to find more clues about
              the history of water there, and to see if the Red Planet could ever
              have supported life. The rovers were sent to two different landing
              sites and landed on opposite sides of the planet.</p>

           <p>Even if Opportunity was designed to run for 90 days, the exploration
              spanned more than 14 years from 2004 to 2018. Along the way, it
              discovered definitive proof of liquid water on ancient Mars and set
              the off-world driving record. Spirit lasted 20 times longer than its
              original design until it concluded its mission in 2010.</p>

           <p><strong>Solar Panels to Collect the Suns Rays:</strong></p>
           <p>The rovers'unique wing-shaped solar panels provide more surface area
              to collect the weak Martian sunlight. That also means more area
              to get covered in the fine reddish dust. Engineers expected some dust
              to accumulate on the panels.</p>

           <p>Opportunity and Spirit were avid documentarians, giving us a
              human-scale view of what it was like to be on Mars. They returned
              over 342,000 raw images, which were promptly posted online for
              everyone´s enjoyment. These two rovers also produced 31 stunning
              360-degree color panoramas.</p>

             <img src="images/Curiosity.jpeg"
                  alt="Curiosity on Mars"
                  class="curiosity" />
             <p><strong>Landed on Mars:</strong> August 2012 at Gale Crater.</p>

             <p>The forth wheeled robot to rove the Red Planet.</p>

             <p>Curiosity is the largest robot to land on another planet and is
                about the size of a small SUV. 10 feet long (not including the arm),
                9 feet wide and 7 feet tall. Because it is so big, it also has bigger
                wheels than the other rovers. This helps it to roll over rocks and
                sand without getting stuck.</p>

             <p>The rover carries instruments that study the Martian environment,
                like surface radiation and weather. It was sent to Mars to
                determine if the planet ever had the proper conditions for
                microbial life to survive.</p>

             <p><strong>"Nuclear Energy":</strong></p>
             <p>The rover is designed to run where the sunlight is too inadequate
                that solar panel is impractical. Everything from its ChemCam, which
                identifies chemical elements using an invisible infrared wavelength,
                to its rock vaporizing lasers will all be powered by nuclear energy.</p>

             <p>The rover brought 17 cameras with it. More than any other rover.</p>

             <p>Curiosity is still active on Mars, currently exploring Gale Crater
                and working on constraining the timing and duration of habitable
                conditions associated with a lake that existed more than 3 billion
                years ago.</p>

             <img src="images/Perseverance.png"
                  alt="Perseverance on Mars"
                  class="perseverance" />
             <p><strong>Landed on Mars:</strong> February 2021 at Jezero Crater.</p>
             <p>The fifth wheeled robot to rove the Red Planet. The rover is, like
                Curiosity, the size of a small SUV.

             <p>The Perseverance rover design is largely based on the engineering
                design for the Mars rover Curiosity. This reliance on a proven
                system reduces mission costs and risks. The Perseverance rover's
                long-range mobility system allows it to travel on the surface of
                Mars over a distance of 3 to 12 miles (5 to 20 kilometers).
                Perseverance has a new, more capable wheel design, among other
                improvements. For the first time, the rover carries a drill for
                coring samples from Martian rocks and soil. It gathers and stores
                the cores in tubes on the Martian surface, using a strategy called
                "depot caching." Caching demonstrates a new rover capability of
                gathering, storing, and preserving samples. It could potentially
                pave the way for future missions that could collect the samples
                and return them to Earth for intensive laboratory analysis.</p>

             <p><strong>"Ears":</strong></p>
             <p>Perseverance has 23 cameras, most of them color. The new rover also
                includes "ears" - two microphones to capture not only the first
                sounds of a Mars landing, but also Martian wind and the rover's
                chemical-analyzing laser zaps. Mastcam-Z, an improved version of
                Curiosity´s Mast Camera, has a zoom capability and will take
                high-definition video and panoramas.

             <p>The rover will look for signs of past or present life, and test a
                method for getting oxygen from the air in the Martian atmosphere.
                This will help NASA plan for the best designs to send human
                astronauts to explore Mars one day.</p>

           <p><strong>Google Earth for Mars.</strong></p>
           <p>Using data and images from the Context Camera(CTX) on MRO and the
              Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity, researchers have already mapped
              90 percent of the Red Planet´s surface down to a resolution of
              about 20 feet (6 meters) per pixel.</p>
          <p>Because OpenSpace is an open-source software, you can access the
             source codes online for free and start building your own
             visualizations. Or you can watch a demonstration of the Mars
             visualizations by OpenSpace.</p>
          <p>Eventually, OpenSpace visualization will be available on YouTube
             in the form of 360-degree videos. For now, those who wish to
             embark on a journey to Mars with OpenSpace can do so at
             New York´s Hayden Planetarium.</p>

            <blockquote>"Curiosity is an everlasting flame that burns in
                         everyone´s mind. It makes me get out of bed in the
                         morning and wonder what surprises life will throw at
                         me that day. Curiosity is such a powerful force.
                         Without it, we wouldn´t be who we are today.
                         Curiosity is the passion that drives us through our
                         everyday lives. We have become explorers and scientists
                         with our need to ask questions and to wonder."
